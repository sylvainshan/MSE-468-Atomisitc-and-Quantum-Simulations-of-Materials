# Materials Simulations with DFT and Molecular Dynamics

This repository contains a series of simulation projects (`lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3`, `lab4`) focused on materials modeling using **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** and **Molecular Dynamics (MD)**. These simulations are performed with industry-standard tools such as **Quantum ESPRESSO** and **LAMMPS**.

Each lab directory corresponds to a separate project, covering different physical systems or simulation objectives.

## ðŸ“‚ Reports

All written reports summarizing the methods, results, and conclusions for each lab are stored in the `reports/` directory. These are provided as PDF files and complement the simulations and notebook analyses.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Frameworks

- **Quantum ESPRESSO** â€“ Used for electronic structure calculations based on DFT.
- **LAMMPS** â€“ Used for classical molecular dynamics simulations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ All analysis and visualization are performed in interactive Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis

Each lab includes Jupyter notebooks for:
- Pre-processing and input preparation
- Post-processing and data analysis
- Visualization of physical properties (e.g., energy, temperature, radial distribution functions, etc.)
